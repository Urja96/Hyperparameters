# This is a Research project based on hyperparameters. This research involves various teams working on different part of the entire research. The main aim of this research is to build a web site where a user can get all the hyperparameters by loading his dataset in the site. These hyperparameters are being predicted by the database of all the hyperparameters generated by this "Hyperparametes project". 

# In this project hyperparameters are generated for different runtimes and algorithms. This project leveraged H2O.
